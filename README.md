# ItemHandler - Tree Structure Project 🌳

This project implements a hierarchical tree structure to manage items and their sub-items using recursive functions in Unity. The `ItemHandler` class handles the creation of trees, adds sub-items to the tree nodes, and performs various operations on the tree structure.

## Project Description 📝

This project uses a tree structure (`Tree` and `TreeNode`) to manage items and their sub-items. Each item (e.g., weapons, shields) can have sub-items (e.g., specific weapons or shield types) which are added recursively to form a complete hierarchy.

### Key Components 🔑:

1. **Item**: Represents categories (e.g., weapons, shields) 🛡️⚔️.
2. **Tree**: Represents the tree structure 🌳 and contains the root node for each element.
3. **TreeNode**: Represents each node in the tree, including the data (item) and its sub-elements 🌲.
4. **ItemHandler**: Manages the elements and organizes them in tree structures ⚙️.

### Functions 🔧:

#### **CreateNArrayTree()** 🌱

- This function loops through the root items (e.g., Weapons, Shields) and creates a tree for each category.
- If a category has no sub-items, it logs a message and skips that category.
- If sub-items are present, it calls `AddChildRecursiveFunction` to add them to the tree recursively.

#### **AddChildRecursiveFunction()** 🔁

- This function recursively adds sub-items to the current tree node.
- It continues to call itself until no more sub-items are found, ensuring the entire hierarchy is built.
- It stops and returns when there are no more children for a particular node.

#### **PrintTreeButtonFunction()** 🖨️

- This function iterates through all created trees and prints the tree structure for debugging purposes using `PrintAllTree`.

#### **CheckItemCanBuyable()** 💰

- This function checks if an item is purchasable by verifying if its parent has been "sold".
- If the parent is sold (`Sold == true`), the item is available for purchase.
- It returns a boolean value to indicate whether the item can be bought.

#### **PrintAllTree()** 📜

- This is a recursive function that prints the entire tree structure from any given start node.
- It prints the connection between parent and child nodes by recursively traversing the tree.

## **NOTE** 📝

The project uses a recursive approach to handle hierarchical data. Initially, the root nodes are defined and assigned, and then the sub-items are recursively added to their corresponding parent nodes.

`               -O-  ==============> This is the root we defined with _Items;
              |   |
        ------O   O------ ============> these are SubItems from _Items[i];
       |                 | ===============> From here on it's already a recursive function;
    ---O---           ---O---
   |       |         |       |
  -O-     -O-       -O-     -O-

 |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |
 |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |
-O- -O- -O- -O-   -O- -O- -O- -O- =========> This is where we return in the recursive function.;`

### Unity Test

You can test the functionality in Unity. Each item in `_Items` is treated as a root. For example, **Weapons**, **Shields**, and **Costumes** are each defined as `Scriptable Objects`, and each of them serves as a root in the tree structure.
